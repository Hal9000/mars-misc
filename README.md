Bits of code dealing with the planet Mars

Not a gem yet. No tests.

File mars\_dist.rb:     class MarsDistance
File orbit\_data.rb:    class OrbitalCalculations
File orbit\_image.rb:   class EarthMarsOrbits

See example.rb

Note that MarsDistance and OrbitalCalculations were written for me;
I only wrote EarthMarsOrbits.

In EarthMarsOrbits, obviously nothing is to scale. In addition, the
orbit of Mars, which is more visibly elliptical than that of Earth, 
has been simplified to a circle. 99% of the people won't notice.
